It looks like it takes a \\'type\\' parameter which can be either \\'game\\' or \\'beta\\'. The user wants both, so I need to make two separate calls.\\n\\nThe query is straightforward, so I should respond with a JSON array containing two objects. Each object will have the same function name but different \\'type\\' values.\\n\\nI should make sure each parameter is correctly spelled. \\'beta\\' is the correct type for beta access, and \\'game\\' for games. Also, the JSON syntax needs to be precise to avoid errors.\\n\\nDouble-checking the default parameter, it\\'s set to \\'game\\', but since the user specified both types, I don\\'t need to set a default; I just include both types in the arguments.\\n\\nSo, the final JSON should have two entries: one with type \\'beta\\' and another with type \\'game\\' for the same function call.\\n</think>\\n\\n{\"name\": \"live_giveaways_by_type\", \"arguments\": {\"type\": \"beta\"}}, {\"name\": \"live_giveaways_by_type\", \"arguments\": {\"type\": \"game\"}}'"

       "'Alright, so I have this query where I need to project the growth of an investment. Let me break down what the user is asking for. They want to project investment growth starting with $10,000 annually, adding $1,000 every year for five years, with a 5% return rate, and considering specific inflation rates over those years.\\n\\nFirst, I remember there\\'s a function called \"project_investment_growth.\" I should check its parameters to make sure I\\'m using them correctly. The principal is the initial amount, so that\\'s $10,000. The annual addition is $1,000, which seems straightforward.\\n\\nNext, the number of years is five, which matches the query. The return rate is 5%, so I need to convert that to 0.05 in decimal form. That part is clear. Now, the inflation rates are provided as a list: [2%, 2.5%, 3%, 3.5%, 4%]. I should represent these as decimals, so they become [0.02, 0.025, 0.03, 0.035, 0.04].\\n\\nThe user also mentioned whether to adjust for inflation, and the default is true, so I should include that in the arguments. \\n\\nI need to make sure I\\'m not missing any defaults or optional parameters. The principal and annual_addition have defaults, but since they\\'re provided, I\\'ll use the given values. The years are set to 1.2 by default, but the user specified 5, so that\\'s correct. The return_rate default is 0.01, but here it\\'s 0.05, so that\\'s properly set. Inflation adjustment is set to true by default, which fits the query.\\n\\nI should structure this in JSON format as specified, without using any variables. The function name is \"project_investment_growth,\" and the arguments are passed correctly with their respective values. I\\'ll make sure the syntax is correct, with commas separating the key-value pairs and the list properly formatted.\\n\\nLet me double-check the data types: principal and annual_addition are floats, years is an integer, return_rate is a float, inflation is a list of floats, and inflation_adjusted is a boolean. Everything seems to align with the function\\'s parameters and the query\\'s requirements.\\n\\nI don\\'t think I\\'m missing anything here. The function call should correctly project the investment growth with all the specified factors.'"
